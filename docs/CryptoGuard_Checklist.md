# CryptoGuard - Project Checklist

> Phased, Skill-Driven Execution
> Generated by IdeaRalph

## How This Checklist Works

This is a **living document** — use it throughout your project, not just at the end.

1. **Work through phases in order** (but some overlap is fine)
2. **Load the skill FIRST** before working on any section
3. **Check items off** only after skill-validated implementation
4. **Update regularly** as you progress

## 🎯 Skill Execution Protocol

**When you want to work on any checklist category:**

### The Required Process

```
Step 1: Load the appropriate skill
Example: spawner_load({ skill_id: "security-hardening" })

Step 2: Work through checklist items using skill guidance
- Follow skill's patterns and best practices
- Avoid the anti-patterns the skill warns about
- Use the skill's detection commands to find issues

Step 3: Mark items complete ONLY after skill validation
- Don't check boxes until skill confirms it's done right
- Skills often catch issues generic approaches miss

Step 4: Update this document with progress notes
```
